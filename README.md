Iâ€™m Muhammed RÄ±za, a full-stack developer from Ä°stanbul, TÃ¼rkiye, with a deep passion for lifelong learning. Yesterday, today, and tomorrowâ€”Iâ€™m always committed to improving myself while also working with AI technologies.

My passion for technology began in childhood. Building small robots and watching my code come to life was an exciting experience. Over time, robotics became a hobby for me. Although I currently focus more on software, I participated in the FIRST Robotics Competition during high school, and in the following years, I assumed the role of a young mentor.

Now, drawing on my professional experiences, Iâ€™m taking steps toward even bigger dreams. With each passing day, I find myself getting a little closer to founding the company Iâ€™ve always envisioned.
